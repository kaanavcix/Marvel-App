# Marvel App

## Introduction

Hello friends, I decided to have to enough time for developing new apps. That's why I found a design and marvel api source. Actually, I am so bored from using a getx state managment and Ä± want to try new technologies and state managements. I prefer to use Flutter bloc and Freezed package.
